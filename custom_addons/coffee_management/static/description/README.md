A comprehensive Odoo module to manage the end-to-end coffee supply chain, from raw bean procurement to finished product sales. This module introduces a highly specialized workflow tailored for the coffee industry, integrating deeply with core Odoo applications.

## üìã Key Features

-   üöö **Specialized Procurement Workflow:** A unique, multi-step process for handling coffee arrivals, from quality to weight to final stock reception, capturing far more detail than the standard purchase workflow.
-   üî¨ **Dynamic Product Generation:** Automatically creates new, distinctly graded `product.product` variants based on quality control results. This ensures your inventory is always tracked by its true, evaluated grade, not a generic name.
-   ‚öôÔ∏è **Direct Manufacturing Control:** Bypasses Odoo's standard MTO route automation for a more explicit, one-click creation of both Delivery and Manufacturing Orders directly from a `coffee.contract`.
-   üì¶ **Intelligent Component Checking:** Proactively checks for raw material shortages before confirming manufacturing orders and creates warning activities for planners to prevent production delays.
-   üìä **Advanced Reporting Suite:** Includes a full suite of wizard-based PDF reports for key metrics and on-screen analytics (Pivot & Graph views) for all major operations.
-   üåç **Granular Data Classification:** Leverages custom models for `Coffee Type`, `Origin`, `ECX Grade`, `Zones`, and `Woredas` to build a highly structured and detailed database of your coffee products.

##  workflows Workflow Deep Dive

This module introduces two primary, interconnected workflows that are highly customized for the coffee industry.

### 1. Procurement: From Arrival to Graded Stock

This flow replaces the standard RFQ -> Receipt process with a more granular set of models and steps.

1.  **`coffee.arrival`**: The process begins. A user creates an arrival record, selecting an `ecx.coffee` master record which represents the expected coffee classification.
2.  **`coffee.quality.evaluation`**: A quality check is performed. Upon saving the evaluation, the system calculates a final **AMG Grade**.
3.  **Dynamic Product Creation**: The system then constructs a product name based on the Origin, Type, and final AMG Grade (e.g., `Raw-Guji-Washed-G1-Coffee`).
    *   If a `product.product` with this name already exists, it's linked to the arrival.
    *   If not, a **new `product.product` is created automatically**. This is a key feature that ensures inventory is tracked by its true, evaluated grade.
4.  **`coffee.weight.history`**: The batch weight is recorded, and a permanent log is created in `coffee.weight.history.log`.
5.  **`coffee.stock.receiving`**: A Goods Receiving Note (GRN) is created. When confirmed, a `stock.picking` is created and validated, moving the specific, graded product into a warehouse location.

### 2. Sales & Manufacturing: The Direct Control Approach

This flow uses the custom `coffee.contract` model, which gives the user explicit control over the creation of downstream documents, rather than relying on Odoo's background MTO automation.

1.  **`coffee.contract`**: A user creates a sales contract for a customer, adding finished goods to the `coffee.contract.line`.
2.  **`action_confirm_contract`**: This button executes a powerful custom logic:
    *   **Creates a Delivery Order (`stock.picking`)** for all lines on the contract.
    *   Simultaneously, for each coffee product line that has a valid Bill of Materials (BoM), it **manually creates a Manufacturing Order (`mrp.production`)**.
    *   It performs a **component availability check**. If raw materials are short, the MO is created in a "Draft" state, and an `mail.activity` is scheduled to warn the user. Otherwise, the MO is confirmed.
    *   The contract state is moved to `Confirmed`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Configuration

### Dependencies
Ensure the following Odoo applications are installed (as listed in `__manifest__.py`):
- `stock`
- `mrp`
- `purchase`
- `sale`
- `product`
- `contacts`
- `account`
- `mail`

### Configuration Steps
A one-time configuration of master data is required for the module to function correctly.

1.  **Geographical Data:** Navigate to `Coffee Management > Configuration` and populate the master data for:
    *   `Zones/Province`
    *   `Woredas/District`
2.  **Coffee Classification Data:** In the same configuration menu, define your company's master data for:
    *   `Coffee Types`
    *   `Coffee Origins`
    *   `ECX Coffee Grades`
3.  **ECX Product Master:** In `Configuration > ECX Coffee Products`, create the base combinations of Origin, Type, and Grade. These are used as templates for the dynamic product creation during the arrival process.
4.  **Finished Goods & BoMs:** For any coffee product you intend to manufacture and sell (e.g., "Roasted Guji G1 Coffee"), you must manually create it as a `Storable Product` and define a Bill of Materials (BoM) for it. The raw material components used in the BoM should be the products that are dynamically created by the arrival workflow.
