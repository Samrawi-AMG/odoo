Overview
========

The Document Page module introduces a dedicated "Documentation" application in Odoo. This allows users to create rich-text documents (using the HTML editor) and organize them into user-defined categories. It is designed to be a core dependency for other modules that require a documentation system, such as those for Quality, Health & Safety, or Environmental manuals.

Features
--------

*   Adds a new top-level "Documentation" application menu.
*   Provides a model to create and manage document pages with titles and rich-text content.
*   Provides a model to create and manage categories for organizing document pages.
*   Simple and intuitive user interface for creating and finding documents.
*   User access rights are managed through standard Odoo security groups.

Dependencies
============

*   This module depends on the Odoo `base` module.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to set up the document categories that will be used to organize your pages.

1.  Navigate to the **Documentation** application from the main Odoo dashboard.
2.  Go to the **Configuration** menu in the top bar.
3.  Click on **Categories**.
4.  Click the **Create** button.
5.  Enter a **Category Name** (e.g., "Quality Procedures", "User Manuals", "Safety Policies").
6.  Click **Save**.
7.  Repeat this process for all the categories you need.

Usage
=====

To create a new document page:

1.  Navigate to the **Documentation** application.
2.  Click on the **Pages** menu item.
3.  Click the **Create** button.
4.  A new form will open. Enter a **Title** for your document page (e.g., "Internal Audit Procedure").
5.  Select a **Category** from the dropdown list that you configured previously.
6.  In the **Content** tab, use the rich-text editor to write the body of your document. You can add formatting, lists, tables, images, and links.
7.  Odoo automatically saves your changes, so there's no need to click a save button manually. Your new document is now available in the list of pages.
