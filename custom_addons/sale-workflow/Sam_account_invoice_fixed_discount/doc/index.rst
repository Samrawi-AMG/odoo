**Account Invoice Fixed Discount Module**

**Overview**

The Account Invoice Fixed Discount module allows you to apply a fixed discount to invoices in your accounting system. This can be particularly useful for offering consistent discounts to certain customers or for applying promotional discounts across multiple invoices.

**Configuration**

The module is designed to be easy to configure and use. The following steps can be used to set up the module:
Before you can use the module, you need to configure it to define the fixed discount rates that can be applied to invoices. This can be done in the module’s configuration settings.
Install the Module: Ensure the module is installed in your accounting software.
Set Up Discount Rates: Define the fixed discount rates that can be applied to invoices. This can typically be done in the module’s configuration settings.

**Usage**

Create an Invoice: Start by creating a new invoice in your accounting system.
Apply a Discount: When editing the invoice, select the option to apply a fixed discount. Choose the discount rate from the predefined options.
Review the Invoice: The system will automatically adjust the invoice total based on the selected fixed discount.
Note: The fixed discount will only apply to the invoice line items that are selected for discount. If you need to apply a fixed discount to all invoice line items, you can select “All” from the line item selection list.

**Example**

Suppose you have a customer who receives a 10% fixed discount on all invoices. When you create an invoice for this customer, you can apply the 10% discount, and the final invoice amount will be reduced accordingly.

**Notes**

Ensure that the fixed discount rates are correctly configured to avoid errors in invoice calculations.
